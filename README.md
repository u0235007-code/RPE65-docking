RPE65 was docked with different classes of ligands: dietary lutein (L), meso-zeaxanthin (MZ), dietary zeaxanthin (Z), beta-carotene, and the chemical compound difluoro-emisustat. L, MZ, and Z belong to the family of molecules called xanthophylls. L, MZ, Z, and beta-carotene belong to the family of molecules called carotenoids. The molecular docking was accomplished with AutoDock VINA. A manuscript describing the molecules and docking outcomes will be submitted for review DEC 2025

The LUT class includes lutein-like molecules with an inverted C3 stereoconfiguration. These LUT ligands are found in several PDB entries for the structures of photosystems and light-harvesting complexes determined by x-ray crystallography or by Cryo-EM to the 2.8 Angstrom resolution limit or better.

Coordinates for molecules were extrated from several PDB entries and saved as .pdb files The coordinates were supplemented with charges and atom types with AutoDock Tools, invoked by the tcsh script pdb2pdbqt_LUT.script which saves each derived ligand as a .pdbqt file. The ligands may be specified as rigid (LUT2) or with rotatable bonds (LUT5).

The .csv files list the names for molecules as found in the PDB and as derived for the .pdbqt files
