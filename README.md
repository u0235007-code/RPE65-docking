RPE65 was docked with different classes of ligands: dietary lutein (L), meso-zeaxanthin (MZ), dietary zeaxanthin (Z), beta-carotene, and the chemical compound difluoro-emixustat. L, MZ, and Z belong to the family of molecules called xanthophylls. L, MZ, Z, and beta-carotene belong to the family of molecules called carotenoids. The molecular docking was accomplished with AutoDock VINA. A manuscript describing the molecules and docking outcomes will be submitted for review DEC 2025.

The emixustat class includes difluoro-emixustat and palmitate, the ligands found in RPE65, PDB ID 7l0e

Coordinates for molecules were extrated from the PDB entry 7l0e and saved as .pdb files
The coordinates were supplemented with charges and atom types with AutoDock Tools, invoked by the tcsh script pdb2pdbqt_emixustat.script which saves each derived ligand as a .pdbqt file. The ligands may be specified as rigid or with rotatable bonds.

The .csv files list the names for molecules as found in the PDB and as derived for the .pdbqt files
