RPE65 was docked with different classes of ligands: dietary lutein (L), meso-zeaxanthin (MZ), dietary zeaxanthin (Z), beta-carotene, and the chemical compound difluoro-emisustat. L, MZ, and Z belong to the family of molecules called xanthophylls. L, MZ, Z, and beta-carotene belong to the family of molecules called carotenoids. The molecular docking was accomplished with AutoDock VINA. A manuscript describing the molecules and docking outcomes will be submitted for review DEC 2025
